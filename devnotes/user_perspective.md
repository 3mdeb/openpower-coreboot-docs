This boot path is executed at every boot except the first one.
Changing system configuration (like the amount of RAM) would probably
make it longer, but not as long as the first boot.

### coreboot first and normal boot

-
    reboots: 0
-
    boot time to skiboot: 24s

## Boot video recording vs the real situation

Before coreboot or Hostboot can be started, the BMC must be already running.
The recordings show only the process of starting Hostboot or coreboot.
This means that BMC had to be started before
(it does automatically after plugging in the power),
and it takes a few moments too.

When the BMC is running, then the main system
can be started through the web browser,
command over ssh or the power button on the computer case
