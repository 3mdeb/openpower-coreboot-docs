### Building binary using source code:

In order to build Heads, use the following command:

```
make BOARD=talos-2_server
```
#### Running the Heads on Talos II

1.
   Copy the Hostboot flash image
   and the result binary from `<Heads_dir>/build/zImage.bundled`
   to the BMC
   (assuming in the Heads root directory):

   ```
   scp build/zImage.bundled root@<BMC_IP>:/tmp/zImage.bundled
   scp build/flash.pnor root@<BMC_IP>:/tmp/flash.pnor
   ```

3.
   Flash the Hostboot binary and replace BOOTKERNEL partition with Heads

   ```
   pflash -E -p /tmp/flash.pnor
   pflash -e -P BOOTKERNEL -p /tmp/zImage.bundled
   ```

   Answer yes to the prompt and wait for the process to finish.

4.
   Log into the BMC GUI again at https://<BMC_IP>/.\
   Enter the Server power operations (https://<BMC_IP>/#/server-control/power-operations) and invoke warm reboot.\
   Then move to Serial over LAN remote console (https://<BMC_IP>/#/server-control/remote-console)\
   Wait for a while until Heads shows up:
