All 3 major DRAM vendors are supported, namely Samsung, Micron and Hynix.

### Building binary using source code:

#### Environment preparation

In order to build coreboot, we use docker container. So in order to setup
environment, ensure that:

1. You have docker installed as described on
   [docker site](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) for your Linux distro.

2. When you have the docker installed pull the container:

   ```
   docker pull docker.pkg.github.com/3mdeb/coreboot/coreboot-sdk
   ```

In order to start from a common point, flash the original OpenPOWER firmware
for Talos II.

1. Log into the BMC via SSH:

   ```
   ssh root@<BMC_IP>
   ```

2. Download the stock firmware image:

   ```
   wget https://cloud.3mdeb.com/index.php/s/canxPx5d4X8c2wk/download -O /tmp/flash.pnor
   ```

3. Flash the firmware:

   ```
   pflash -E -p /tmp/flash.pnor
   ```

   > You will see warning like `About to erase chip !` and
   > `WARNING ! This will modify your HOST flash chip content !`. When the
   > `Enter "yes" to confirm:` prompt appears, type `yes` and press enter.

   At the end of the process (it may take several minutes) you should have
   something like this:

   ```
   About to program "/tmp/flash.pnor" at 0x00000000..0x04000000 !
   Programming & Verifying...
   [==================================================] 100% ETA:0s
   ```

4. * Log into the BMC GUI at https://<BMC_IP>/. \
     Make sure to use `https`.
   * Enter the Server power operations
     `https://<BMC_IP>/#/server-control/power-operations` and invoke
     warm reboot.
   * Then move to Serial over LAN remote console
     `https://<BMC_IP>/#/server-control/remote-console` to observe
     whether the platform is booting.

#### Buidling coreboot image

In order to build coreboot image, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the coreboot repository:

   ```
   git clone git@github.com:3mdeb/coreboot.git -b TBD_TAG_NAME
   # or HTTPS alternatively
   git clone https://github.com/3mdeb/coreboot.git -b TBD_TAG_NAME
   ```
   `talos_2_support_ramstage` - ramstage devlopment branch - merge requests should go here.\
   `squashed_talos_2_support` - upstream branch, can be regularly pushed with force.\
   `talos_2_support` - legacy branch for bootblock and romstage release - as of today nothing should be pushed here.

2. Get the submodules:

   ```
   cd coreboot
   git submodule update --init --checkout
   ```

3. Start docker container (assuming you are already in coreboot root
   directory):

   ```
   docker run --rm -it -v $PWD:/home/coreboot/coreboot -w /home/coreboot/coreboot docker.pkg.github.com/3mdeb/coreboot/coreboot-sdk /bin/bash
   ```

4. When inside of the container, configure the build for Talos II:

   ```
   make menuconfig
   ```

   * Navigate to the **Mainboard** submenu.
   * As a **Mainboard vendor** select `Raptor Computing Systems`.
   * Select Exit and then navigate to the **Payload** submenu.
   * In **Add a payload** select `skiboot`.
   * Save the configuration and exit.

   ![make menuconfig mainboard](../images/cb_menuconfig_ramstage_mainboard.png)
   ![make menuconfig payload](../images/cb_menuconfig_ramstage_payload.png)


5. Start the build process of coreboot inside the container:

   ```
   make
   ```

#### Running the coreboot on Talos II

1. At the end of build process you should see `Built raptor-cs/talos-2 (Talos II)`.
   Copy the result binary from `<coreboot_dir>/build/coreboot.rom.signed.ecc` to the BMC
   (assuming in the coreboot root directory):

   ```
   scp build/bootblock.signed.ecc root@192.168.20.9:/tmp/bootblock.signed.ecc
   scp build/coreboot.rom.signed.ecc root@192.168.20.9:/tmp/coreboot.rom.signed.ecc
   ```

2. Backup the HBB partition (for faster later recovery) by invoking this
   command on BMC:

   ```
   pflash -P HBB -r /tmp/hbb.bin
   ```

3. Flash the binary by replacing HBB partition (execute from BMC):

   ```
   pflash -e -P HBB -p /tmp/bootblock.signed.ecc
   pflash -e -P HBI -p /tmp/coreboot.rom.signed.ecc
   ```

   Answer yes to the prompt and wait for the process to finish.

4. Log into the BMC GUI again at https://<BMC_IP>/.\
   Enter the Server power operations (https://<BMC_IP>/#/server-control/power-operations) and invoke warm reboot.\
   Then move to Serial over LAN remote console (https://<BMC_IP>/#/server-control/remote-console)\
   Wait for a while until coreboot shows up:

   TBD asciicast

5. Enjoy the coreboot running on Talos II.

> **Optional:** In order to recovery the platform quickly to healthy state, flash
> the HBB partition back with: \
> `pflash -e -P HBB -p /tmp/hbb.bin`
